# Dama
Dama is a chessboard game. The goal is to take down all the pieces of counter part pawn. If the pawn reaches the other end of the board then It will be upgraded hence called Dame pawn which of course has an advantage of having a more unrestricted moves or a leap moves where a regular pawn can just one cell at a time or if there is an eat move.
